    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>With over two decades of experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end the user.</p>
    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
    <p>I am a fullstack developer that specializes in Angular, Bootstrap, firebase, javascript, mongoDB, mysql, nodejs, PHP, postgresql, python, React.JS/React Native, raspberry pi, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
    <p>I am also familular with Android Studio, AWS, Digital Ocean, docker, and heroku.</p>
    <p>I use Linux and Windows Os's</p>
    <p>I am a graduate of Columbia University's bootcamp.</p>
